HtmlEntry
  - text inside functions doesn't get escaped properly.
  - Skips Uebersetzung section (likewise in other langs), except maybe for the other lange of interest.
  - Build single EN/DE/IT/FR dictionaries based on HtmlEntry.
  - Parse Italian verb forms from enwiktionary into something useful.
  - "See also" link entries for cross-referencing ("form of"--strong, links to token, "mentioned in"--weaker, links to HtmlEntry).
   Nice:
  - Add links into the HtmlEntry based on wikilinks.
  - Link to them from the appropriate places: IndexEntry (first), and individual rows (tricker, built at different times).

Hitory of lookups.

make sure word is sticky when you change dictionaries.

- on small device it would be great to be able to hide the system status bar and the title bar
- an history list of the searched words per dictionary with the possibility of having a rudimentary flash card game from it to memorise new words

For next release:

Ok, good to know.  I will put in Dutch-Greek in the next release, and see if I can separate the Ancient Greek from the modern Greek.
